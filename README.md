## What is AerialWaste?

AerialWaste is a dataset for the discovery of illegal landfill. Illegal landfills from aerial images present a visual heterogeneity of the scenes in which waste dumps appear and with the diverse nature of the objects that compose a waste deposit. When observed from above waste dumps appear as complex arrangements of objects of different shapes, sizes, and orientation.

The dataset contains {numer_of_images} images from three different sources: Ortophotos (20cm GSD), World-View3 (30cm GSD) and GoogleEarth (50cm GSD).

Highlights:
- Annotations refer to the presence of a waste dump as a whole and to the visibility of specific types of garbage.  
- Ground truth labels are provided by professional photo interpreters specialized in the use of aerial images for landfill detection.
- The annotations support multiple CV tasks: binary and multi-class image classification and weakly supervised localization. 
- The dataset adheres to the standard MS COCO format.
